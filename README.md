### What is ThirdGenerationCoin?
[ThirdGenerationCoin](<add website>) (abbreviated TGC), is the first known [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency)  designed as a combined [proof-of-stake](http://ThirdGenerationCoin.org/static/ThirdGenerationCoin-paper.pdf)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) system that can be mined using a special "Dcrypt" algorithm. ThirdGenerationCoin is build upon [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/) and [PeerCoin](http://peercoin.net/), but unique in the fact that it is more energy efficiency, as proof-of-stake blocks require minimal energy consumption. The Dcrypt algorithm is extremely anti-asic and currently can only be mined with a CPU. It is made so mining with hardware will be inefficient, given the intensity of this algorithm, thus forcing the users to mine through the proof-of-stake. Thus, with ThirdGenerationCoin energy consumption would decrease over time as proof-of-work blocks become less rewarding and coin generation becomes increasingly based on proof-of-stake block generation.
